# Girls-In-Tech

This branch is intended to be used a sandbox to enable smooth code mixing of the different pages and files from all the contributors, and to ensure that while the mixin is carried 
out there is a safe and original version of such files to fall back to in the original master branch, incase there is a conflict encountered.
